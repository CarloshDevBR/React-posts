<p align="center" >First reaction project that was developed in a udemy course with Professor Ot√°vio Miranda. In this project we consumed the JSONPlaceholder api and made a very simple page using the reaction state to display 8 items at each click of the button, we were also made a filter to be able to filter the posts by title.
Jest was also used to test the components of the application.</p>
